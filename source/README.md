## Source Contents

### Development Source for Work

The UFO source files on the path:

```
source/ufo/Hack
```

should be used for all work on the fonts.  The font variants are included in their own UFO sub-directories on that path.  This set of files was generated from FontLab Studio VI write to UFO source files from the v2.018 Hack PostScript .vfb source files.


### Source for Quality Assurance

These source files should not be modified. They were generated from various font editor and script to UFO source file approaches in order to assess for differences in the way that UFO source writes occur.

These include the source files on the path:

```
source/ufo/QA
```

### Source from Upstream Hack Repository

These source files were branched from the upstream Hack release repository and **should not be modified in any branch**.

##### Source generated from VFB source files with the vfb2ufo tool
```
source/ufo/vfb2ufo
```

and

##### Master source files for current v2.x Hack releases
```
source/vfb
```
