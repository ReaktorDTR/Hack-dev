## Source Contents

### Development Source for Work

The UFO source files on the path:

```
source/ufo/Hack
```

should be used for all work on the fonts.  The font variants are included in their own UFO sub-directories on that path.


### Source for Quality Assurance

These source files should not be modified. They were generated from various font editor and script to UFO source file approaches in order to assess for differences in the way that UFO source writes occur.

These include the source files on the path:

```
source/ufo/QA
```

### Source from Upstream Hack Repository

##### Source generated from VFB source files with the vfb2ufo tool
